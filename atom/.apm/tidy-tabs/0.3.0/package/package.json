Find yourself rage-quitting all your tabs in disgust and starting over? No? Just me? Ok.\n\nWith this plugin, a simple keystroke `ctrl + alt + shift + w` will close all tabs whose file has not been modified in the last 15 minutes (to change this interval, see *Configuration* below). It will only close tabs in the background â€“ so files that are open and active in your window won't be closed. Likewise, it will not close files with unsaved changes.\n\nYou can also configure the plugin to run automatically.\n\n##Configuration\n\nYou can configure the plugin by opening the Atom Settings pane, then clicking *Packages* in the left column, then searching for *tidy-tabs*. Click the *Settings* gear to make changes to the configuration.\n\n###Configuration options\n\n####Accessed threshold\nDo not close tabs that have been accessed in the last *n* minutes.\n\n####Miniumum tabs\nDo not close tabs until there are more than this number of tabs open in the given pane.\n\n####Modified threshold\nDo not close tabs that have been modified in the last *n* minutes.\n\n####Run on save\nWhen enabled, Tidy Tabs will run every time a file is saved.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/bradleyboy/tidy-tabs-atom/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/bradleyboy/tidy-tabs-atom#readme","_id":"tidy-tabs@0.3.0","_shasum":"05f0f5a8128205c61a5b59e418297b00426ffaed","_resolved":"file:../d-116427-21621-1764986/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116427-21621-1764986/package.tgz"}
